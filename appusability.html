                        My app usuability review was assigned to me in an HCI class. I was required to choose an app that I was not super familiar with and examine its design principles. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Memorizing information could be hard for many people. Some people want to track the amount of calories they eat, track how many steps theyâ€™ve taken in a day, or other personal things that they seem to always forget. The app, Flo, does exactly that. Within the app, users are able to log information that is important to them, keep track of that info, and be able to access it at any given time. The app is specifically used for tracking period and ovulation cycles."

                    <p>
                        This review highlights all deisgn principles from both the user and designer's point of view. I pointed out the potential difficulties a user can have if they are using th app for the first time. I also gave suggestions on how the app could be improved so that the user can navigate through the app easliy.

                        I enjoyed working on this review a lot. This made me realize that I like working on these kinds of projects, I enjoy writing about the usuability of apps. The amount of research that had to go into this was minimal but I found myself doing research just for fun. I think that I will have more research projects in the future and this was a great start to that.
