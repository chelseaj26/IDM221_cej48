                This project was my second project as an IDM student. I was required too choose a site that I thought needed some work and redesign it so that the website was more appealing to the users.  This time I was required to use two new softwares that I have never used before. I used Sketch and Flinto to design and animate my site to bring it to life. 
            <p>
                The website I chose to redesign is CopyKat. It is a website filled with great recipes, but I beleievd the design of the website didn't do those great recipes justice. The initial website that I redsigned is no longer available, it has been redesigned. 
            <p>
                When I first saw the site I wasn't displeased. There was a great amount of content that was kind of scattered, but the overall structure of the site was okay. I decided to make it easier to navigat eand spice it up a bit by adding cool transitions and animations.
            </p>
            <p>
                Using new software such at Flinto was challenging at first because I had no idea where ot start, but once I got the hang of it I was able to really bring the site to life with all the animations and transitions. Working on this project helped me learn more about the multitude of animations that can go into a site to make it more appealing.
