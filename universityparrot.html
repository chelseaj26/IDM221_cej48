                University Parrot was a group project that I did with three of my fellow classmates. The initial prompt was to find any interaction in everyday life that you can improve. We all brainstormed together and decided that an interaction that was annoying to us was signing guests into dorm buildings. 
            </p>
            <p>
                When it comes to signing people into the dorm buildings, there's about 20 steps that need to be completed. We figured that that system was out-dated and we proposed a fresh idea that is more tech centered to cater to the current college demographic.
            <p>
                Our proposed idea was a sign in app called University Parrot (this name wasn't generated until we had the app idea fully fleshed out first). We decided on this name for the app because our group name was "Purple Parrots" we took that, threw in "University" and went with it. Our challenge statement was, "The process to sign in a guest at any of the dorms or apartments on campus is a lengthy and tedious process that takes a decent chunk of time from both you, your guests, and security. Not only is this an extensive process, but also a confusing one since it is different for each building you enter."  
            </p>
            <p>
                We went through many different phases of the app. We had to research many aspects of the app. The research we did was mostly about security of the app and the users. We also researched how other companies have implemented sensors and loaction services to track peope within the dorm buildings for their safety.

                My role was mostly research and documentation. I also helped pitch ideas, color schemes, and font recommendations based on research. In this project I became the unofficial information architect of the group.
            </p>
            <p>
                Developing an app with a small group was very interesting to me. It was a great learning experience and I learned how to split up work within groups but still have an understanding of what everyone was working on.
