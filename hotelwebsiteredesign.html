                This project was my very first project as an IDM student. I was required too choose a site that I thought needed some work and redesign it so that the website was more appealing to the users.  
            </p>
            <p>
                The website I chose to recreate is Exmouth View Hotel's website. Although the site is no longer up, the website was in desperate need of a redesign.
