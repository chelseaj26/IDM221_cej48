                This project was my very first project as an IDM student. I was required too choose a site that I thought needed some work and redesign it so that the website was more appealing to the users.  
            </p>
            <p>
                The website I chose to redesign is Exmouth View Hotel's website. Although the site is no longer up, the website was in desperate need of a redesign.
            <p>
                My first reaction when I saw the site was, "woah...". I was completely speechless because everything was just so choatic. I had to make it more organized. Since it was my first time ever redesigning something, I had to pull inspiration from other sites that shared the same purpose. I looked at many hotel websites and decided on what I wanted mine to look like and I exucuted it. 
            </p>
            <p>
                My overall experince with this project was great. I truly enjoyed the whole process of it. I never thought I would be able to redesign part of a website. I honestly didn't even know where to start in the beginning but towards the end of the project I felt myself wanting to do more. My completed resdesign was a good start for the begnning of my design career and felt I learned a lot about the design world I am entering.
